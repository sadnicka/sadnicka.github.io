Task-specific dystonia has a number of features that identify it as an outlier from other dystonias.  The range of environmental influences and association with specific tasks offer windows into mechanism if interpreted within motor control science.  Furthermore, the unreliability of [traditional neurophysiological markers ](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00221-020-05773-3) and [distorted somatotopy model](https://academic.oup.com/brain/article/146/4/1511/6726536?login=true) motivate the need for alternative ways to understand the disorder.  By integrating the contemporary neuroscientific literature in skill learning with decades of clinical reserach in patients we offer a [unifying motor control model](https://www.nature.com/articles/nrneurol.2017.146).  This offers a neural architecture and vocabulary to describe different deficits and predicts the efficacy of [retraining](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0079612319300871?via%3Dihub) methods such as differential learning.
