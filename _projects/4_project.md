Despite the gross motor disability experienced by patients, when examined experimentally many performance metrics are remarkably intact.  One reason may be that the focus has been wrong, repeatedly exploring movement rather than then core deficit of postural control.  Shifting experimental focus to the neural control of hold has been highly revealing. We are also exploring the tying of movement to subsequent hold using robotic integration tasks.
