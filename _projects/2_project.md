Human pose estimation is a computer vision technique that tracks the position of key points on a person's body in an image or video. [Phenomenology in Movement Disorders](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-031-52573-5) is a video encyclopedia of clinical movement disorders expertly curated by Steven Frucht and Pichet Termsarasab.
