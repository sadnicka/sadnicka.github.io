Kate Sampson is a Research Physiotherapist and Highly Specialised Physiotherapist in Neurosciences, focusing on innovative neurorehabilitation approaches for hyperkinetic movement disorders. Throughout my career, I have worked across the patient journey from hospital to home, which has enabled me to gain rich experiences with patients presenting a vast range of neurological pathologies in diverse settings.

My research addresses a critical gap in neurorehabilitation literature by exploring hyperkinetic movement disorders, an often-underrepresented area. Currently, my work aims to investigate the experiences of Dystonia patients accessing Physiotherapy in the UK and to develop novel treatment approaches for Dystonia rehabilitation.
