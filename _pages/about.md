***Quantitative human motor neuroscience across health and disease***

We study human movement as a high-dimensional behavioural output of the nervous system. Our research combines quantitative movement tracking, wireless neurophysiology, and computational modelling to understand how motor control is organised, how coordination and variability emerge, and how these processes are altered in neurological disease.

A central goal of the lab is to develop rigorous, reproducible methods for measuring behaviour in naturalistic settings. By characterising the structure and variability of movement and relating these features to neural and physiological signals, we aim to build mechanistic accounts that link circuit-level function to observable action.

Movement disorders provide a powerful window into motor system function, offering well-defined perturbations of control and coordination. Insights from this work inform our understanding of disease mechanisms and support the development and evaluation of targeted neuromodulation and neurorehabilitation strategies.

We are an interdisciplinary group based at the [Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/gatsby/gatsby-computational-neuroscience-unit), with experimental work conducted in purpose-built human movement laboratories in the [Department of Motor Neuroscience and Movement Disorders](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/ion/research/research-departments/department-clinical-and-movement-neurosciences). Our research sits at the interface of human motor neuroscience, computational neuroscience, and experimental methods development, with a strong emphasis on open, reproducible tools and datasets that lower barriers to quantitative movement research and enable reuse across laboratories, disciplines, and settings.
