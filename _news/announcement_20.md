Looking forward to [Advances in Motor Learning II](https://uobevents.eventsair.com/advances-in-motor-learning-ii/) (11–12 December, University of Birmingham). Mireia and Marta will present work on _'Decoding rating scales in movement disorders'_, Marta and Iván will give an update on _Building scalable tech for behavioural sampling in clinical populations_.  My keynote within the disorders sections will aim to tease apart mechanism in task-specific dystonia.
