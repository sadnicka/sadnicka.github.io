A commissioned practice pointer on dystonia in the [BMJ](https://www.bmj.com/content/377/bmj-2020-062659). The late [Adam Kalinowski](https://dystonia-europe.org/2022/12/in-memoriam-for-president-adam-kalinowski/) skillfully sculpted content.  We hope it will increase awareness of dystonia and offer a clinical roadmap for patient management.
