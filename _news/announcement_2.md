The similarity of eyeblink conditioning behaviour in dystonia and controls is against a global deficit in cerebellar learning.  Published in [Movement Disorders](https://movementdisorders.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/mds.28967) we discuss how these findings inform models of cerebellar involvement in the pathophysiology of dystonia.  A research digest also available in Dystonia Matters written for [Dystonia UK](https://www.dystonia.org.uk/).
