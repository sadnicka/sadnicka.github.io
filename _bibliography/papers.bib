  abstract = {Background: Medical treatments for task-specific dystonia (TSD) often have limited long-term success, leading to interest in rehabilitative approaches. Our previous feasibility study supported the acceptability and short-term benefits of sensory-motor rehabilitation for a cohort of 12 individuals. Long-term outcomes remain unknown. Purpose: Investigate the long-term (7 year) follow-up of clinical outcomes and treatment effectiveness in participants with TSD who engaged in our previous feasibility study. Methods: Online surveys and telephone interviews were undertaken at 1 and 7 years. A telephone interview was completed at 7 years. Results: All 12 participants (seven musicians dystonia, five writing dystonia) who had completed the original feasibility study took part. All showed improvements in clinical outcomes at one and 7 years (effect sizes 0.25-0.93). Interviews and surveys indicated continued use of effective rehabilitation strategies 7 years after completing the program. Discussion: Following treatment, people continue to use rehabilitative strategies, perceived by them as effective, with sustained benefits across varying domains for up to 7 years. Conclusions: Benefits of sensory-motor rehabilitation can be sustained. The underlying mechanisms of these changes require investigation.},

    abstract = {In functional neurological disorder (FND), there is a fundamental disconnect between an apparently intact nervous system and the individuals’ ability to consistently perform motor actions, perceive sensory signals and/or access effective cognition. Metacognition, the capacity to self-evaluate cognitive performance, appears highly relevant to FND pathophysiology. Poor metacognition is a potential mechanism via which abnormal models of self and the state of the world could arise and persist unchecked. There is therefore a justified enthusiasm that studies of metacognition may give substance to FND’s intangible nature. However, many assume an impairment in metacognition even though experimental studies are still in their infancy. This systematic review provides an analytical checkpoint of the evidence after the first five years of experimental work. We firstly summarize current methods for testing metacognition, prerequisite knowledge that allows readers to independently evaluate the evidence. Using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, we then screened the 21 articles on this topic and review the experimental data of the eight studies that specifically tested metacognition in subjects with FND. Questionnaire metrics used to estimate global metacognition and general confidence in FND revealed a mixed picture of low or normal confidence. Of the five studies that used performance-controlled metrics, the gold-standard to estimate local metacognition in FND, four found metacognition to be equivalent to healthy controls and one paper supported impaired metacognition. We consequently try and broaden the debate and discuss alternative headline scenarios. We review how positive studies may offer insight and debate whether null studies could represent false negatives. However, since most studies find equivalent metacognition to controls, we also discuss whether metacognition could be intact and how this could inform mechanistic models of FND and have potential clinical utility. In summary, this review highlights signal of interest within the data, exposes current limitations and flags the many open questions.},

  title={What can kinematic studies tell us about the mechanisms of dystonia?},
  abstract={Background: Impaired eyeblink conditioning is often cited as evidence for cerebellar dysfunction in isolated dystonia yet the results from individual studies are conflicting and underpowered. Objective: To systematically examine the influence of dystonia, dystonia subtype, and clinical features over eyeblink conditioning within a statistical model which controlled for the covariates age and sex. Methods: Original neurophysiological data from all published studies (until 2019) were shared and compared to an age- and sex-matched control group. Two raters blinded to participant identity rescored all recordings (6732 trials). After higher inter-rater agreement was confirmed, mean conditioning per block across raters was entered into a mixed repetitive measures model. Results: Isolated dystonia (P = 0.517) and the subtypes of isolated dystonia (cervical dystonia, DYT-TOR1A, DYT-THAP1, and focal hand dystonia) had similar levels of eyeblink conditioning relative to controls. The presence of tremor did not significantly influence levels of eyeblink conditioning. A large range of eyeblink conditioning behavior was seen in both health and dystonia and sample size estimates are provided for future studies. Conclusions: The similarity of eyeblink conditioning behavior in dystonia and controls is against a global cerebellar learning deficit in isolated dystonia. Precise mechanisms for how the cerebellum interplays mechanistically with other key neuroanatomical nodes within the dystonic network remains an open research question. © 2022 The Authors.

  title={Intact finger representation within primary sensorimotor cortex of musician's dystonia},
  abstract={Musician’s dystonia presents with a persistent deterioration of motor control during musical performance. A predominant hypothesis has been that this is underpinned by maladaptive neural changes to the somatotopic organization of finger representations within primary somatosensory cortex. Here, we tested this hypothesis by investigating the finger-specific activity patterns in the primary somatosensory and motor cortex using functional MRI and multivariate pattern analysis in nine musicians with dystonia and nine healthy musicians. A purpose-built keyboard device allowed characterization of activity patterns elicited during passive extension and active finger presses of individual fingers. We analysed the data using both traditional spatial analysis and state-of-the art multivariate analyses. Our analysis reveals that digit representations in musicians were poorly captured by spatial analyses. An optimized spatial metric found clear somatotopy but no difference in the spatial geometry between fingers with dystonia. Representational similarity analysis was confirmed as a more reliable technique than all spatial metrics evaluated. Significantly, the dissimilarity architecture was equivalent for musicians with and without dystonia. No expansion or spatial shift of digit representation maps were found in the symptomatic group. Our results therefore indicate that the neural representation of generic finger maps in primary sensorimotor cortex is intact in musician’s dystonia. These results speak against the idea that task-specific dystonia is associated with a distorted hand somatotopy and lend weight to an alternative hypothesis that task-specific dystonia is due to a higher-order disruption of skill encoding. Such a formulation can better explain the task-specific deficit and offers alternative inroads for therapeutic interventions.},

  title={Between nothing and everything: phenomenology in movement disorders},
  abstract={In movement disorders, phenomenology refers to the science and art of classifying abnormal movements. Traditional clinical practice has been based on phenotype-driven investigation, diagnosis, and management. However, many have questioned our continued reliance on phenotype. Phenotype has been repeatedly demonstrated to be an unreliable guide to the precise lower-level pathophysiological process. After all, a single phenotype can be caused by multiple diseases and a single genetic disorder can be associated with varied phenotypes. There has been a growing call for molecular subtyping to have priority in scientific research.

In this Viewpoint, we redebate the relevance of phenotype, arguing that we may be using phenotype in the wrong way. We discuss how a better appreciation of this many-diseases-to-few-phenotypes process can allow our experimental literature to be more effectively understood. We suggest that the convergence of many diseases onto a limited number of phenotypic patterns may reflect the fact that the sensorimotor system can only “break” in a limited number of ways. Therefore, if we can understand the system-level processes that underpin specific phenotypes, this could unlock novel phenotype-specific therapies regardless of the specific underlying disease process. Encouragingly, many existing therapeutic tools such as neuromodulation already target system-level processes.},

  abstract = {During a clinical lecturer role, parallel clinical and academic training is undertaken. The anticipation is that a lectureship represents an exciting and expansive time. However, a national crisis has been declared at the clinical lecturer level with a leaky pipeline of clinical academics resulting in dwindling numbers. Clinical lecturers are infrequently represented as a group partly due to their distributed nature and diverse job plans. We conducted a survey of clinical lecturers in the UK. Responses (n = 107) revealed a motivated but divided workforce. A content analysis revealed core elements that sculpt an individual’s success or failure, but these were variably present. COVID-19 had a negative effect on many with various strategies reported to try and reset academic trajectories. Feelings of isolation and anxiety about a viable future in academia were significant findings. This echoes calls for a greater number of secure longer-term grants to ensure that clinical academics and their skills are retained within the research workforce. A continued effort to analytically appraise whether supportive elements are in place for all lecturers will help focus initiatives to foster excellence in clinical academic training for everyone.},

  author={Sadnicka, Anna and Wiestler, Tobias and Butler, Katherine and Altenmuller, Eckart and Edwards, Mark J and Ejaz, Naveed and Diedrichsen, J{\"o}rn},
  abstract={Task-specific dystonia leads to loss of sensorimotor control for a particular motor skill. Although focal in nature, it is hugely disabling and can terminate professional careers in musicians. Biomarkers for underlying mechanism and severity are much needed. In this study, we designed a keyboard device that measured the forces generated at all fingertips during individual finger presses. By reliably quantifying overflow to other fingers in the instructed (enslaving) and contralateral hand (mirroring) we explored whether this task could differentiate between musicians with and without dystonia. 20 right-handed professional musicians (11 with dystonia) generated isometric flexion forces with the instructed finger to match 25%, 50% or 75% of maximal voluntary contraction for that finger. Enslaving was estimated as a linear slope of the forces applied across all instructed/uninstructed finger combinations. Musicians with dystonia had a small but robust loss of finger dexterity. There was increased enslaving and mirroring, primarily during use of the symptomatic hand (enslaving p = 0.003; mirroring p = 0.016), and to a lesser extent with the asymptomatic hand (enslaving p = 0.052; mirroring p = 0.062). Increased enslaving and mirroring were seen across all combinations of finger pairs. In addition, enslaving was exaggerated across symptomatic fingers when more than one finger was clinically affected. Task-specific dystonia therefore appears to express along a gradient, most severe in the affected skill with subtle and general motor control dysfunction in the background. Recognition of this provides a more nuanced understanding of the sensorimotor control deficits at play and can inform therapeutic options for this highly disabling disorder.},
